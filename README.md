This project was made for the single purpose of entertaining myself, and this little project fulfilled it fully.
To compile it, just use make.


-f option selects 6502 program file. Emulator puts program at address 0x200 and stops at BRK instruction.
-v option outputs status of all registers and current instruction on every tick.
-s [n] option sets time between ticks (default 0).


If you used this program, and liked it, know that I am very happy for you.
I don't guarantee that this program works, and if you broke something up because of the result of running this program,
 it't on you (No warranty or everything like it is provided).
 Have fun.


Posted it before on gitlab, but forgot password to that acc, and dont wanna spend my time restoring it.
